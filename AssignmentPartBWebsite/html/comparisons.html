      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a soccer fan I want to compare the stats between two different players so that I can see how each player compares to one another and judge who is the better player.<br>
Given that the players are within the database and have enough stats, when two players are clicked and selected to be compared, then the statistics of those selected players should be displayed on the users screen side by side so that they can be compared against each other.
</p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>With the opening screen keeping it simplistic with three buttons with the two empty slots and the compare button makes it very easy for users to navigate and compare the players. <br> With a grid layout when displaying the players information, it allows for an easy distinction between whose stats are whose with the split of the screen.</p>
        
      <h2>Validation Criteria:</h2>
      <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Task</th>
            <th>Click on the compare button and have both players stats appear</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If succeeds</td>
            <td>Both players stats will be displayed on the next screen with the players stats displayed side by side</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>If failed</td>
            <td>The display will not change and an error will have occurred with no information on the players to be displayed and have to retry comparing those players.</td>
        </tr> 
      </table>
