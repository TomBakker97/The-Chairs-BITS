      <h2>User Story:</h2>
      <p>As a huge football fan, it would be my dream to meet Cristiano Ronaldo in person however due to the current pandemic it makes it practically impossible for me to do this.  I would love for someone to design a way for me to meet my hero without leaving the comfort of my living room.  <br><br> Because of the pandemic, I cannot have real life interactions with people. Creating a feature inside of an app that brings the players into a virtual world when my phone is plugged into something like a google cardboard device. This in turn should immerse me into a world where that player is visible as if he is really there.</p>
      <h2>Design Notes and considerations:</h2>
      <p>-To open the VR feature the user will have to navigate to the player card of their choosing and click upon the VR button that can be found in the top right<br><br>-Unsure of if in the app we will have the player picture and stats remain static or have them follow the users movements. The likely outcome will probably be whatever the team gets working first</p>

        <tr>
            <td>If failed</td>
            <td>if the fucntion fails to initiate the user will be stuck on the player cards page wondering why the button does nothing</td>
