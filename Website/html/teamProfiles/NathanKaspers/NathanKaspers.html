      <h1>Student name</h1>
      <p>Nathan Kaspers</p>
      <h1>Student number</h1>
      <p>s3668382</p>
      <h1>Background and Passion in IT</h1>
      <p>I grew up in a town called Hamilton 4 hours west of Melbourne. Given that it was such a small town, there wasn't much around to do. It was during this time that I took up an interest in technology. This is what inspired me to pursue a career in IT, and thus I enrolled in an advanced diploma of computer systems engineering. After completing this course I found that I liked some aspects more than others encouraging me to move away from that industry and more into a general IT field hence a Bachelor of IT. </p>
      <h1>What are you good at/interseted in?</h1>
      <p>When I wasn't spending my time on the computer at home, I was on the soccer field. I have been playing for the RMIT soccer team for the past 2 years, however, due to the current pandemic it isnâ€™t a possibility right now.</p>
      <h1>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs</h1>
      <p>In terms of weaker points I find that my coding skills are lagging a little behind where they should be however this can definitely be worked on and still benefit the projects needs. </p>
      <h1>what role do you expect to be performing in the project</h1>
      <p>I expect to play a bit more of a leadership role making sure people are aware of what they are doing and making sure everything is contributed however I also expect to play a part in the designing of the features as my interest is in soccer and my knowledge could benefit the team and the project.</p>
