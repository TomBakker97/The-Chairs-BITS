      <p>I believe this would be one of my weaknesses that needs development. My challenges in the context of this project would be how I communicate with my team members. I would like to contribute to discussions on regularly to improve my interpersonal skills for the benefit of the team.</p>
      <h1>what role do you expect to be performing in the project</h1>
      <p>Specific tasks which I see myself contributing to are scheduling/managing the time we need to spend as a group to work on certain tasks and correcting grammar and punctuation mistakes.</p>
