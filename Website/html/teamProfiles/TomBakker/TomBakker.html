      <h1>Student name</h1>
      <p>Thomas Henry Bakker</p>
      <h1>Student number</h1>
      <p>S3671963</p>
      <h1>Background and Passion in IT</h1>
      <p>My hobbies at the moment are probably just playing video games and some light reading. My passion in IT began when I built my computer, since then i've been exploring more and more of the of the computer world and have really started to enjoy coding.</p>
      <h1>What are you good at/interseted in?</h1>
      <p>There isn't really something that I feel confident enough in pointing to and saying that it's something i'm good at. I hope that through the creation process of the project it can become a bit more clear for myself where my strengths are.<br> I'm defientiely interested in programming and hope that I can help with that portion of the project</p>
      <h1>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs</h1>
      <p>I'm not to confidfent in my current java skills despite it being something I enjoy, i'm hoping this project will further my development my coding skills not just in relation to Java but other languages as well.</p>
      <h1>what role do you expect to be performing in the project</h1>
      <p>I'm not really sure where I fit in best with group so far, however, I'm hoping to take on a more technical aspect of the project like the coding portion or something similar if there are others that want to take that role.</p>
