      <h1>Student name</h1>
      <p>Matthew Falzon</p>
      <h1>Student number</h1>
      <p>S3842548</p>
      <h1>Background and Passion in IT</h1>
      <p>My hobbies at the moment include playing video games, listening to music and watch/playing sports. My passion in IT started when i first learnt how to hyperlink text together and creating a connection of different sources.</p>
      <h1>What are you good at/interseted in?</h1>
      <p> I do not think their is a field that i would say that i am good at but have practised using HTML, CSS and Java. I hope through this whole project that i can focus these skills to become better and more qualified. I am more interested in the networking side of IT as my programming abilites have never been amazing, however through this project maybe i can consider taking a programming pathway in the future.</p>
      <h1>What are your weaker points in the context of the project needs</h1>
      <p>I not the most confident in my CSS skills. I'm hoping at one stage during this project i will be able to adjust or create my own design for a web page that needs to be designed for the group</p>
      <h1>what role do you expect to be performing in the project</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure exactly what skills the rest of the group have however i do not mind helping with the design aspect of the project and suggest ways to help the practical side of the project so the project is able to run more efficiently.</p>
