    <h2>Group Contract</h2>
    <h3>Expectations around meetings</h3>
    <p>All members are expected to attend all meetings and need to notify other members when they cannot, exceptions apply such as family emergencies etc.</p>
    <h3>Assignment of work</h3>
    <p>All group members are expected to assign themselves a reasonable workload via trello so that no members are left doing more or less than others.</p>
    <h3>Process of unmet expectations</h3>
    <p>Members that are found to be not doing what's expected will be talked to, to try and help them understand what is neccessary, if no improvments are made then a poor sparkplus review should be expected.</p>
    <h3>Method for peer feedback</h3>
    <p>Messages and team meetings will be used for feedback</p>
    <h3>Frequency of responses</h3>
    <p>A message is expected to be replied to within 24 hours of its sending.</p>
    <h3>Tools used in the context of the weekly workflow</h3>
    <p>The team will be using Microsoft teams as our primary form of communication in which we have attached a trello extension to help us keep track of who's doing what on a week to week basis.</p>
