    <h1>Project Motivation</h1>
    <p>What motivated our group to choose such a project was because of how sports such as soccer were cancelled due to the circumstances which have affected the world. Due to this reason we had come up with the idea to create and design an application where people would be able to see the statistics of soccer teams and players using Virtual Reality (VR). We believe that since people were/are unable to expereience these matches, by using VR it would provide a similar and intriguing experience for users as it would make it seem as if they were looking at a player in person. </p>
    <h2>How does it relate to your individual and collective interests</h2>
    <p>This project relates to our individual and collective interests as three of the members: John, Matthew and Nathan all have an interest in sports, some being soccer. This would allow for a wider range of ideas for the app as these members would have an understanding of what the targeted users would want to see.  Hon's interest in cybersecurity and Thomas's interest in programming would both relate to and benefit the coding behind the app as the code itself is very essential for the app to work. As most of the group members have a similar level of programming to each other, by working on this project, it is expected that by the end of it, their confidence in their skills for IT would be strengthened as we are regularly working on software such as GitHub.</p>
    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>We will produce an app that can compare different clubs and players against each other. The app will have a tab for compare where players and teams can be selected to compare. This will be validated with two players having their stats displayed side by side next to each other.<br>
The application produced will be utilize VR to display player stats. The app will offer users to see player stats through VR interacting with player or team in a VR scenario. This will be validated with the option of VR given to users when looking across stats and displaying the “world”.<br>
We will produce an application that allows for favourite clubs and players to be selected and prioritized. The app will have a favourites tab where it displays selected teams and players first on the dashboard of the application. This will be validated by having those teams and players selected as favourites and displayed in their specific tab and dashboard.<br>
The application produced will contain iconic players of the past. The app will display statistics of iconic players of the football to be looked at and compared to other players. This will be validated when the player search has the option for icon players and contains those said players.<br>
