    <h1>Project Motivation</h1>
    <p>What motivated our group to choose such a project was because of how sports such as soccer were cancelled due to the circumstances which have affected the world. Due to this reason we had come up with the idea to create and design an application where people would be able to see the statistics of soccer teams and players using Virtual Reality (VR). We believe that since people were/are unable to expereience these matches, by using VR it would provide a similar and intriguing experience for users as it would make it seem as if they were looking at a player in person. </p>
