    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>As the world is heading towards an era where everything is expected to be mobile, we have decided to create a mobile application based around the sport of soccer. On this app you will be able to search for players and teams across the globe in all the major leagues, presenting you with individual player statistics, team stats, and of course league and game results. Users are able to input their own personal profile where they can select a favourite team and player. Doing so will automatically display their statistics and information on the home page. After having added their personal information to their profile, the user will receive automatic notifications when their selected team/player is playing. Along with these features, we are giving users the opportunity to compare players against other players, and teams with other teams. This will allow them to see which team will perform better for their fantasy league or which player would better suit their FIFA Ultimate team. These statistics are not just limited to current players but also previous players such as David Beckham, giving users the opportunity to compare his stats to current players and see how he would perform against the tough players of today. To set our app apart from the rest we have also decided to incorporate a Virtual Reality feature that allows users to immerse themselves inside of a virtual environment. This virtual environment will feature an interactive view of players as well as a virtual display that shows all of the current statistics of the viewed player.</p>
