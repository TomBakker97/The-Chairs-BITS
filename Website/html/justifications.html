    <h1>Project justification</h1>
    <h2>Workload</h2>
    <p><a href="timetable.html">Group’s project schedule</a><p>
    <p>Our project schedule is based on every team member’s ability, we analyse our team’s ability and making sure that the tasks are distributed evenly to every member. For example, Tom have the experience of managing the github, so he is assigned to manage the github project. And Nathan have the experience of hosting the AWS, so he is in charge of host the AWS.<p>
    <h2>Beyond Current Capabilities</h2>
    <h3>Tom Bakker</h3>
    <p>I think outside of the design portion the majority of the project is outside of my current capabilities, however this aspect is something i'm looking forward to, the process of learning while we create should be fun. The only thing I think we may struggle with is getting our VR feature fully implemented in time</p>
    <h3>Nathan Kaspers</h3>
    <p>I think the coding aspect of this project is beyond my current capabilities however throughout the semester learning in the programming 1 course along side this could really benefit my knowledge and help me strive to where I need to be in order to complete the required tasks for the project.</p>
    <h3>John Usaraga</h3>
    <p>Having basic knowledge in coding, I beleieve that all the coding part of the project is beyond my current capabilities, so by working on this project, I hope to improve my skills and confidence in programming.</p>
    <h3>Matthew Falzon</h3>
    <p>I think other than desinging the rest of the project is outside of my current capabilites with only basic of knowledge of HTML, CSS and Java. Howver this creates a big learning experience for everyone and allows me to improve my skills and contribute and help where others may have struggled.</p>
    <h3>Hon Son</h3>
    <p>I think that coding is beyond my current capabilities, I will improve my coding skills by completing this course.</p>
    <h3>Minh Hoang Pham</h3>
    <p>I think desinging is beyond current capabilities. I will learn more about design application.

    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>Risk 1: VR function is not stable  
<br>Description: The VR function are very lag, and the VR function cannot be used on some older version of android. 
<br>Mitigation: We disabled the VR function if the user using version older than android 10, and this will give us more resource to develop the VR model and provide the best performance.
<br><br>Risk 2: Error of the voice assistant 
<br>Description: The voice assistant function cannot provide the best solution to the user’s problem.
<br>Mitigation: We input more data into the AI, so the AI can learn from these data and provide better solution to the user. 
<br><br>Risk 3: Compatibility between IOS and Android.
<br>Description: The IOS system are not compatible with the Android system. 
<br>Mitigation: We decided to make an android app to reduce the cost and time, and this will give us more resource to develop the VR model and provide the best performance.
